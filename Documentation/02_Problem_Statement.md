# PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Title
Development of Faculty Availability & Appointment Management System (EduMeet)

## Background
In educational institutions, students frequently need to meet faculty members for academic guidance, project discussions, doubt clarification, and career counseling. Currently, the appointment scheduling process is manual and unorganized, leading to various challenges.

## Current Challenges

### 1. Manual Coordination
- Students have to physically visit faculty cabins to check availability
- Multiple visits are often required if faculty is busy
- Time-consuming process for both students and faculty

### 2. Communication Gaps
- No centralized system to check faculty availability
- Difficulty in reaching faculty through phone or email
- Missed appointments due to lack of reminders

### 3. Time Slot Conflicts
- Multiple students may arrive at the same time
- Faculty schedule gets overbooked
- No mechanism to prevent double booking

### 4. Lack of Transparency
- Students cannot track appointment status
- No record of past appointments
- Difficulty in rescheduling appointments

### 5. Administrative Overhead
- No centralized monitoring system
- Difficult to generate appointment reports
- Manual record-keeping is error-prone

## Problem Definition
**"How can we create an efficient, digital system that allows faculty members to manage their availability and enables students to book appointments seamlessly while preventing scheduling conflicts and maintaining transparency?"**

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. Develop a web-based appointment management system
2. Implement secure user authentication for students, faculty, and admin
3. Enable faculty to define and manage availability slots
4. Allow students to view availability and book appointments
5. Prevent time slot conflicts through automated checking

### Secondary Objectives
1. Provide appointment status tracking
2. Maintain appointment history
3. Enable appointment cancellation and rescheduling
4. Create admin dashboard for monitoring
5. Ensure data security and consistency

## Expected Outcomes
