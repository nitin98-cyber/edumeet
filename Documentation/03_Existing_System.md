# EXISTING SYSTEM & LIMITATIONS

## Existing System

### Current Appointment Process

#### Method 1: Physical Visit
- Students physically visit faculty cabin
- Wait outside if faculty is busy
- May need to return multiple times
- No prior information about availability

#### Method 2: Email Communication
- Students send email requesting appointment
- Wait for faculty response (may take days)
- Back-and-forth emails to finalize time
- No confirmation mechanism

#### Method 3: Phone Calls
- Students call faculty directly
- Faculty may not answer during busy hours
- Difficult to coordinate with multiple students
- No record of conversation

#### Method 4: Notice Board
- Faculty posts available hours on notice board
- First-come-first-serve basis
- No booking mechanism
- Students may arrive at same time

### Existing System Workflow

```
Student needs appointment
    ↓
Tries to contact faculty (visit/email/call)
    ↓
Faculty responds (if available)
    ↓
Time slot discussed verbally
    ↓
Student notes down time manually
    ↓
Student arrives at scheduled time
    ↓
Meeting happens (if no conflict)
```

## Limitations of Existing System

### 1. Time Inefficiency
- **Problem**: Students waste time in multiple visits
- **Impact**: Loss of productive study time
- **Example**: A student may visit faculty cabin 3-4 times before getting an appointment

### 2. Lack of Availability Information
- **Problem**: No centralized system to check faculty schedule
- **Impact**: Uncertainty and frustration
- **Example**: Students don't know when faculty will be free

### 3. Scheduling Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple students may book same time slot
- **Impact**: Confusion and wasted time
- **Example**: Two students arrive at 2 PM for same faculty

### 4. No Record Keeping
- **Problem**: No digital record of appointments
- **Impact**: Disputes and confusion
- **Example**: Student claims appointment was at 3 PM, faculty remembers 4 PM

### 5. Communication Barriers
- **Problem**: Difficult to reach faculty quickly
- **Impact**: Delayed responses and missed opportunities
- **Example**: Email sent on Monday, response received on Friday

### 6. No Status Tracking
- **Problem**: Students cannot track appointment status
- **Impact**: Uncertainty about confirmation
- **Example**: Student doesn't know if appointment is confirmed or cancelled

### 7. Manual Coordination Overhead
- **Problem**: Faculty spends time managing appointments manually
- **Impact**: Reduced time for core academic activities
- **Example**: Faculty receives 20 calls per day for appointments

### 8. Lack of Flexibility
- **Problem**: Difficult to reschedule or cancel appointments
- **Impact**: Rigid system with no adaptability
- **Example**: Faculty wants to cancel all appointments due to emergency

### 9. No Administrative Control
- **Problem**: Admin cannot monitor appointment system
- **Impact**: No insights or reports available
- **Example**: Cannot generate monthly appointment statistics

### 10. Accessibility Issues
- **Problem**: System depends on physical presence
- **Impact**: Remote students cannot book appointments
- **Example**: Student in hostel cannot check faculty availability

## Disadvantages Summary

| Aspect | Limitation |
|--------|------------|
| **Efficiency** | Time-consuming manual process |
| **Transparency** | No visibility of availability |
| **Accuracy** | Prone to human errors |
| **Scalability** | Cannot handle large number of users |
| **Record-keeping** | No digital records |
| **Accessibility** | Requires physical presence |
| **Conflict Management** | No automatic conflict detection |
| **User Experience** | Frustrating and uncertain |

## Need for Automation

The limitations of the existing system clearly indicate the need for an automated, digital solution that can:
- Provide real-time availability information
- Enable online appointment booking
- Prevent scheduling conflicts automatically
- Maintain digital records
- Offer transparency and tracking
- Reduce manual coordination effort
- Improve overall user experience

This need forms the foundation for developing the **EduMeet: Faculty Availability & Appointment System**.
